# use-template begins with either 'y' or 'n' and it is required.
# interpreter and args are not needed. If they are not given then
# the file is read out (possibly with a template around it).

# suffix use-template interpreter args...

# suffix could match more than just the extention of a file name,
# so long as it is the last part eg: index.md or dex.md or .md or md
# would all be valid and match index.md.

# in template, parse with...
md yes markdown
sh yes sh
py yes python

# return raw, in template
